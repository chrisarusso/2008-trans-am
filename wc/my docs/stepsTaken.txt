1. After setting up the instance, I preloaded the text, page, and revisions tables with all of the cities in the db.
 	The pages were set up wiht text of welcome...blah blah become the founder of [city name]!  
 	
 2.  I wrote a very small hook that turns the page to unprotected once someone edits it.  We want each page to have a founder with an email
 
 3.  I enabled upload of files (defaulted to disabled) in local settings.php
 
 4.  I enabled subpages of the main namespace (defaulted to false) in local settings.php
 
 5.  Added googlesitesearch seems to need some config.  ---MIGHT WANT TO REVERT ON THIS----
 
 6  Added protecte section extension (for the ad space) and also added a new group into the extension to serve my purpose.
 
 7. Added a line to special preferences to include the city the person's from... and perhaps any special citizenship... (todo)
 
 8 Added functions to user.php to return city user belongs to
 
 9.  Added to notifications within profile as a placeholder to remind that we'll need to put more here.
 
 10.  Modifed userlogin.php in includes/template to force a person to sign up with a city.
 
 11.  Added code to myHooks.php but needs to be rewritten, and refactored and all that jazz.
 
 12.  Created php file to parse through db and auto-insert all necessary categories, pages, and subpages for all of wikiCommunity.

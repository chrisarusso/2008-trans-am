		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

I read your final blog in the last place you and I saw each other and as usual I am thankful for the very interesting read in this very boring place.  I hope you understand why I was not able to &quot;ride along with you&quot; in the latter part of the adventure.  As you get older and have your own kids you will come to realize that the accomplishments of your children are far more important than your own.  What you and Paul have done far outweighs any accomplishments that I have had.  There aren&#039;t words to express how proud I am of you and Paul and Mom I am eternally thankful that you are our son.

Love,

Mom and Dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I, too, am in tears.  I could not be prouder than both of you.  Chris, your good fortune was in Paul&#039;s acceptance of your invitation  to step up to the plate.  The memories you two have given us are indescribable.  We stand in awe of both of you and what you were able to accomplish.  The people you met along the way who opened their hearts and homes to the two of you have  renewed our faith that not only is Life good but so too are people.  

Paul and the Yovino family, we thank God every day for choosing the right people for us to share this experience.
Nina was always there for me whenever I doubted  Chris and/or Paul.  I will never forget the bond we shared.

Love and Peace to all

And I guess this is finally &quot;it.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So... I am in tears. Fait acÂ·comÂ·pli!  I am so very proud of you both.

Chris, for months, your writings kept me aware, smiling &#038; sane! As I have said before, it has been Paul&#039;s good fortune in life to attract only the best of friends. I couldn&#039;t have asked for anyone finer, funnier, smarter, stronger (physically &#038; mentally), or more fun, industrious &#038; sincere to be the road warrior companion and friend of a son who has done nothing less than make me proud his entire life.  I have embraced you in my heart, where you will remain, as anyone who has so touched my life remains. 

A bonding of families, friends &#038; strangers has occurred, one which may be indescribable to outsiders. The karma was good hence life was good, may it always be so... Here&#039;s to many more inspiring &#038; enlightening journeys.

Nina &#038; Family

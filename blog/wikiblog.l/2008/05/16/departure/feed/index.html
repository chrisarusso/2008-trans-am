		<description><![CDATA[Hey Paul &#038; Chris ~ Hi,

I am truly impressed &#038; amazed how you put this together physically &#038; mentally with less time than it took me to accept it. It has helped to be able to watch the traveling (all day :-) &#038; read about your journey ~ this I&#039;m lovin. Seems like you&#039;re both doin &#039;so well&#039; so really, I&#039;m thrilled!

As I mentioned, I&#039;ll be calling out to some friends &#038; Classmates from WB who may be in your path. In the meantime, be sure to pack some nourishment &#038; keep track of weather conditions across the country, please.

I&#039;m looking forward to seeing some good pictures &#038; I agree, stop where you&#039;re able to enjoy the view...
Be safe &#038; well &#038; enjoy the ride ~ I&#039;m with you all day, each day!
 
Ny ~ xoxo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris and Paul (not sure if I know you but I think you also deserve credit for making the trip) - I&#039;m so jealous of you guys. Looks like you&#039;re making some pretty good progress so far. Those bridges from key to key must have been some amazing sights - and camping out in the everglades is no joke. Hope everything&#039;s going well so far. Stay well nourished, but most of all enjoy the trip! You guys are going to see some amazing sights and I know how motivated you are Chris but definitely stop to enjoy it once in a while. Be safe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Quernas let you guys in but not the dogs sprayed by a skunk?  I don&#039;t get it.  Hope the knee works itself out.

Thanks again to the great hosts for putting up with our sons.
Be safe guys.

Love,

mom and dad Russo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey there, Chris and Paul,
I arrived from Maine and just had to commit to reading your experiences.  What a trip for all of you, people out there are quite trusting and certainly accommodating toward you all.  What a great experience for you.  The pics are beautiful.  I worry about Chris T. and his trip to Glacier Natl. Park hoping they won&#039;t meet up with any hungry bears.  I want to give him alot of bells to hang from their tent so it will scare the bear away.  We talked about the bear repellant, which still has to arrive here.  Chris expects to leave with Nick, uncle, and brother on 8/8.  
Will keep on reading and checking out the pics now since home from Maine.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Chris,   This is such a fabulous trip you two are doing.  I&#039;m not getting my work done, reading about your trip and experiences instead.  Chris T. and Nick C. will be leaving for the great Glacier Natl. Park 8/8.  I want them to be decorated with noisy bells to scare the bears away.  Your often mentioned desserts sound good, all to be burned away with all the exercise.  Your trip down the coast of CA should be breathtaking, also. I have a friend in Redwood City, CA who owns a surveying company in San Mateo, CA.  Knew him from high school  He would surely meet you guys.  I&#039;ll check with him with specifics if we can move fast enough with you guys.  Karen T.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;M STILL READING AND ENJOYING YOUR NARRATION!  I WAS CURIOUS WHY YOU DID NOT FOLLOW THE COAST INTO MISSISSIPPI AND ENDED UP IN NATCHEZ.  HOPE YOU LOVED NEW ORLEANS AS MUCH A WE DID.  WE WOULD DRIVE OVER JUST FROM A SATURDAY AND HAVE LUNCH AND DINNER.  NEW ORLEANS WAS LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM GULFPORT, MS.  SOUNDS LIKE A TRIP OF A LIFETIME.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Chris,

I&#039;m loving this.

My favorite part you ask? &quot;Whenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the last time you were greeted in the morning to a crocodile leaping out of a lake near your tent, that you had to outrun to save your life? I bet never, right? Yeah me either...&quot; Hahah.

Keep up with the great stories and fun coverage I&#039;m really enjoying your trip vicariously through your blog. Sweet photos too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So do you actually carry around a thesaurus to write your blogs, or do you use the one on Microsoft Word(R)?  Because the vocabulary you use....damn.  You sound so intellectual, articulate and educated.  

Good thing that you can type blogs instead of having to hand write them...&#039;cause that would certainly put an end to any notion that you were educated. 

Say word.

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like food is a BIG part of your day!!!  I still haven&#039;t tried McD&#039;s sweet tea, but I think of you two whenever I see that commercial.  I also think of you when I am in my spinning class at the gym and wonder how you do it day after day, mile after mile, state after state.  We all enjoy the blogs and now more of the pictures make sense once you know the story behind them.  Hope the weather continues to shine on you!

Ride the good ride, stay safe and have fun!

Love you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

Besides the great people you meet and the good advice you receive (25 minutes on the phone), it sounds like you are enjoying the food at your stops (sonic smoothie and Gumbo?).  I know you are writing all the recipes down so you can wow us with great food when you get back.  Meghan called from Hawaii to wish me a happy father&#039;s day.  Might see her at Greg Scrittoralle&#039;s when she gets back.

Happy Trails to you (plural),

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a beautiful sunset!  Your trip is fun to read and see, especially on such a lousy day today.  Here it is the 4th.
Congratulations to Mark.  
Chris T. is up in Maine with a load of friends, looks as though Maine may be beautiful with great sun presently.  Dad, Ralph, is surrounded with everyone, and he says he is going to read!  Your trip is sure an eye opener seeing the country and not having to purchase any gas.  The truckers have to look at you both with envy.  
Be careful, and watch out for the surprise showers where you may sleep.

		<description><![CDATA[If in doubt in a tornado, do what they do in Twister and tie yourself to a tree or something with a belt. I suppose you would have to go buy a belt, so you may want to think of something related to a belt... I bet you didn&#039;t know that I was interested in TV/movies, did you?]]></description>

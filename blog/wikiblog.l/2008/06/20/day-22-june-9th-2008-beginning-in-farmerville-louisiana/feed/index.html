		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

This open forum is not a place for a lecture (you rarely listened anyway!!!..and you are too old to listen now) but I think we discussed the need for a good weather report in that area of the country.  We need you guys to finish this thing with all of your body parts (not to mention our daily entertainment or minute to minute in mom&#039;s case).  The police officer and firehouse were awesome.  As mom stated, the firehouse photos now make sense.

Happy trails to you!

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,
I love the blogs. I&#039;m very glad you eluded the tornado! I keep an eye on the weather and wonder how you&#039;re doing! I also enjoy hearing the stories of all the great people you are meeting along the way. It&#039;s uplifting to know there are so many helpful people out there! Keep pedaling!

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m the biggest hater in the work of the phrase, &quot;ATM machine&quot;.  Drive me nuts.  I almost hate the phrase, &quot;it is what it is&quot; as much.

However, I ate lunch at a place a few weeks ago that offered: &quot;Complimentary free fruit.&quot;  

I assume the apples cost $0 and say &quot;you&#039;re looking handsome today&quot; when you purchase them.

Anyway, you&#039;re ATM Machine photo reminded me of that story so I thought I&#039;d share.

See you soon.]]></description>

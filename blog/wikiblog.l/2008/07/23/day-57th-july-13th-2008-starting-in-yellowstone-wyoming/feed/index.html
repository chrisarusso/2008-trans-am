		<description><![CDATA[Chris and Paul,

We just finished our vacation on Saturday, July 26, after four days on the Rosebud Indian Reservation outside of St. Francis, South Dakota for their annual Sundance. Susan&#039;s brother Jim was completing his four year commitment as a dancer (four days of dancing from sunrise to sunset) and we were there as a family to support him. We camped out on the Sundance grounds amidst buffalo dung, but didn&#039;t have to sleep with any buffalo this time around.

It&#039;s been 20 years since my last &quot;summer of biking across the U.S.&quot; I&#039;m glad you&#039;re getting experiences similar to what I had all those years ago. I had been wondering recently if people like you were having good experiences bicycling across the country... or if the country had changed too much. Your blog has answered my question. Thanks. It was a pleasure meeting both of you, and to have a chance to relive some of those memories.  Jeff]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris and Paul,

Glad to hear that the bear was probably a bison (not really sure that is so much better!).  J + S + family sound great.  The stories of the people you meet suggests that in general people are good (especially the ones who are crazy enough to sleep with bison, bears, and wolves).

Enjoy the sights, wildlife, and he people and stay safe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unlike the others I know you were overstating the altitude for emphasis.  I hope the bottles in your Polish horseshoes were empty!
Passing up on a party to get ready for Trail Ridge Road....sounds pretty focused to me.  WOW!

Happy trails]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Funny Donna ~ I just figured I didn&#039;t get it! 

I&#039;m wondering how life back home is ever going to compare with life on the road, so much to do, so much to see!

I hear they&#039;re creating a &#039;brightly colored bike lane&#039; on Broadway in Manhattan... hmmn.  Please don&#039;t discount the NE yet fellas, you haven&#039;t taken those bikes thru the &#039;Great State of Maine&#039;... (JT).

Knowing the past 2 days have been rough (OMG the wind SOUNDS UNIMAGINABLE) I&#039;ll hope today puts the wind at your back! It appears that Yellowstone National is right around a mountain or two. 

Remind me at some point to recite the 50&#039;s (?) state song which few people I know seem to recall &quot;What did Della-wear boy...&quot;  Anyone? 

Be well &#038; safe.

After absorbing jesting ridicule and mockery from me on the subject, Mark would later suggest that maybe there was some energy at the vortex in Sedona and that it was the reason for my early rise. There may have been other reasons, but it&#8217;s &#8230; <p class="link-more"><a href="https://wikiblog.l/2008/10/25/day-121-september-16th-2008-beginning-in-sedona-arizona-and-ending-in-boston-massachusetts/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "Day 121, September 16th 2008, beginning in Sedona, Arizona and ending in Boston, Massachusetts"</span></a></p>]]></description>

When Mark returned, I got up.

We had placed ourselves on a waiting list for the Phantom Ranch, which is a hotel on the canyon floor.

I started with the Natural History Museum . They had a big water theme to many of their exhibits.

We had the time, so I figured I would check it out.

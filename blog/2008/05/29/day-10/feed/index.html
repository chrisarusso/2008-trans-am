		<description><![CDATA[Sweet Tea...great story.  After reading that, I had to try it out.  The stuff if pretty good and pretty much what I expected.  Although I&#039;m sure it all comes from the same place, something tells me that the people running the McDonald&#039;s in the southern locations make it a little bit better than in Plainville, CT.  Anyway, although it was delicious, it probably would be the worst thing to drink while exercising.  I could understand how it wouldn&#039;t sit right the Tour de Florida.  Lance would have puked -- he&#039;s got nothing on you.  Tell me where I&#039;m wrong.  Take care.  Stay safe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris &#038; Paul,

When you guys stayed with us we talked about the idea of Paying It Forward.  Since that time you&#039;d be amazed how many times the topic has come up.  The most recent event was today when the mail arrived.  We received a package in a plain brown wrapper with no message that had a note on the back.  It said &quot;Pay It Forward.&quot;  Inside was a copy of the movie.  Now we&#039;ll be able to see for ourselves how this &quot;thing&quot; got started.

Are you guys responsible for this?  It made our day!!!

Good luck guys!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys,

Thanks for the latest updates.  We&#039;ve been wondering how you&#039;ve been doing and now we know.  

You didn&#039;t mention the tailwinds, but we know you&#039;ve had them.  We&#039;ve been keeping track of the weather and see you&#039;ve been pushed along the past couple of days.  Sure makes the miles go by easier.  We hope they keep up for you.  

Glad to hear you picked up some peanut butter and bread.  It&#039;ll sure come in handy, especially through the rural areas ahead of you. 

Keep up the great work!  We&#039;re back home cheering you on.  BTW, the map thing is great.  We keep checking during the day to follow your progress.  Makes it like we&#039;re right there with you.

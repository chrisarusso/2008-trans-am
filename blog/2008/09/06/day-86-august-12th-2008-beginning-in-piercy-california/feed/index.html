		<description><![CDATA[120 miles behind you with breakfast nearby in the morning and the sounds of the ocean and the sea lions as a backdrop.....how does it get better than that?  When you work hard at something the really important things in life come shining through and the rest of the crap falls by the wayside.

You two have treated us for 86 days and just wanted to tell you again how impressed we are with what you are doing and letting us come along.  The shooting star was the icing on the cake!!!!!

safe journey!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been waiting for my dreams
To turn into something

I could believe in
And looking for that
Magic rainbow
On the horizon
I couldn&#039;t see it
Until I let go
Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn
Now I&#039;m coming alive
Body and soul
And feelin&#039; my world start to turn

And I&#039;ll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time, 
This is the time of me
To be more than a name
Or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time
This is the time of my life
Time of my life

Holding onto things and vanished
Them to the air
Left me in pieces
But now I&#039;m rising from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed
Was there all along
Within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

And I&#039;ll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time, 
This is the time to be
More than a name
Or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time
This is the time of my life
Time of my life

And I&#039;m out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
I&#039;m keeping my feet on the ground
My arms open wide
My face to the sun

And I&#039;ll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time, 
This is the time to be
More than a name
Or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time
This is the time of my life
Time of my life
More than a name
Or a face in the crowd
This is the time
This is the time of my life.
This is the time of my life.
Life
Time of my life
Time of my life]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looks like it was a great time for you and the kids but making Nolan and Grace carry the groceries from Trader Joe&#039;s might have been an oversight.  You actually cooked?  I am impressed!!!!  Hope you get to play soccer.  Good food, a bed and a great family around you is hard to beat.

happy trails]]></description>

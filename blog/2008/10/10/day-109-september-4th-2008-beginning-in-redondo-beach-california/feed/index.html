		<description><![CDATA[I gotta tell you Chris, without the blog I&#039;d know so very little! It appears you guys had so much fun and made the best of everything ~ embracing the moments, the company and life. Having been living vicariously thru you both for so many months, I&#039;m slowly withdrawing from your travels and reading these blogs sporadically now has become my little fix.
Hope all is and are well, Nina

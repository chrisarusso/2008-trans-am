		<description><![CDATA[Rising before Mark is a great accomplishment but don&#039;t expect it to happen again.  I knew that this great adventure you and Paul (as well as Mark this week) are on would have far reaching effects.  We actually took mom&#039;s bike out of the attic (been there for 20 yrs) and she just came in to tell me she tried it.  So you do have an effect on all of us back here as we follow your blogs.  How long do you think it would take us to reach the grand canyon?  Dream on!!!!

be safe]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Meghan has quite the sense of humor (hi Meghan)!  Since everyone else said it I guess I will too...the blog is worth it!!!!!!  How else are we going to travel along and enjoy the ride?

Yes, cooking for someone can be a really nice thing to do for someone.  So when you come home you can cook me a dinner.
Just joking!

Hope you and Paul have even greater experiences ahead.

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just spent like 2 hours catching up on a month&#039;s worth of your blogging. I call it a productive day at work. I read them and I feel like I am really there and then I look away from the monitor and realize that I am actually at work and would much rather be on the trip with you guys. Sounds like you guys are making out pretty well and enjoying CO very much - I&#039;m glad to hear it because I will be snowboarding at Copper Mtn. in Mar. 09. I have especially enjoyed the run-ins with the police stories and the defiant attitudes you have. It&#039;s not like you&#039;re speeding away from the crime scene so its just funny to hear that they are giving you a hard time in some places. Hopefully I will not be reading about any overnights in jail (although it might be nicer to sleep in an actual bed than on the ground in a tent under some early morning sprinkler). Haha - keep up the good work, and I will be looking forward to more blogging.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In answer to your question... Yes, it is.  For us &#038; yourself. Not sure how you&#039;re tucking the info away for the day when you actually have a chance to write it out, but you&#039;re doing a very job &#038; your catching up to a pretty current date, which is another impressive feat. It&#039;s good to mix it up, physical challenges, mental challenges ~ fun!

You may be heading into Wyoming today, if so, pack &#038; be well and,  ride safely. Much love to you both from your Ct fans!]]></description>

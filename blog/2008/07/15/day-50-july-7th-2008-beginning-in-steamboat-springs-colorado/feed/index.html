		<description><![CDATA[Hey Paul &#038; Chris, 

Sorry I haven&#039;t written but while you were writing about basking in the beauty of Steamboat Springs, I was relaxing on the South Bay. Not quite the same but also pretty beautiful. 

You managed to persevere thru those Rockies and judging by the recent pictures, they&#039;ve made you both sooooooo strong! I have to say that stretch stressed me a bit. Colorado seems like &#039;The State&#039; to date and the land in Wyoming is equally as awesome, remarkable to see so much land &#038; no stores (or homes). Quite different from life as we know it. You got some really nice shots.

I did forewarn you about the &#039;Bison&#039; &#038; now it appears you&#039;ve become acquainted :-) Heavy. Can&#039;t wait to read that blog. Anyway, an open home to all those you&#039;ve been blessed with on the Tour de US. Oh, I saved you an article on the recent Tour de France, interesting.

Safe traveling in Montana.
Love &#038; xoxo]]></description>

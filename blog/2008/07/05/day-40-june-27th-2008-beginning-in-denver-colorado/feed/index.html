		<description><![CDATA[I guess the early bird gets the worm (or muffins).  I guess rising early has its benefits but you should have fought the hunger urge and saved some for Paul!!!!

We were glad to hear you guys were able to hook up with Lauren.  Sounded like a fun relaxing time.  Good deal on the admission ticket to the water park and storage of your bags.

Mom did remind me that just because I never ate a breakfast burrito it doesn&#039;t mean the rest of the world doesn&#039;t!  Darn 21st century!

I think they changed some natural laws on me in this century as well (more about that later).

Keep the blogs coming!!!!!

love,
mom and dad]]></description>

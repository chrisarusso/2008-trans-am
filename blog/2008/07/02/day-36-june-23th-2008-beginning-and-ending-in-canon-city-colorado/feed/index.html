		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

The police officer must have been originally from Bristol!  Sorry we couldn&#039;t get photos of the rafting but Paul&#039;s protective footware was exciting.

Mom is a pretty good poet!  I could overnight my John Denver cd to motivate you guys over the rockies...let me know.

enjoy the ride to the fullest (we are jealous).

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the picture with the CT flag, is that a part in your hair or helmet hair?
And Billy has recently made me feel bad because he pointed out that I do not say many words of encouragement, so keep up the good work!!! (I hope that helps you through your next big ride)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The blogs are coming faster!  I think the antennas sort of give the location of the base away (maybe it is a diversion).

Looks like the people in the bar were dressed to kill!!!
Mountain  photos are great!

Glad to see the &quot;k&quot; is back (breafast).

Fireworks poping every night here (you hear any?).  Notice the deeper I get into summer the shorter the sentences?

be safe.

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

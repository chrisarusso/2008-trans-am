		<description><![CDATA[O jeez. To top off your adventures, we add spitting water at you at 2am. At least those 16-year-old girls didn&#039;t come back for Paul. .. or the police. 

And remember, the air isn&#039;t thinner, the air pressure is increased so your hemoglobin cannot attach to the oxygen molecules. Duh! : )

And I quote from &#039;Go For It!&#039;: If the going is easy, take care: you may be headed downhill.  Also: You can&#039;t leave footprints in the sands of time if you&#039;re sitting on your butt. And who wants to leave buttprints in the sands of time? 
Just a few notes from my bathroom.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I read all the snap decisions you have to make (rerouting the tire etc) I can&#039;t help but wonder how people did this before GPS and cell phones.  Yes I know all you young readers, I have to join the 21st century!  But the 20th century was so much fun!!

Awesome picture with the shirts and the mts in the background.

Maybe the spot you picked was part of a golf course with a sprinkler system).  Boy how I wish I could be sleeping there instead of my soft warm bed.

Good luck in Denver.

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was wondering when your pyromaniac skills of your youth were going to come in handy.  Nice fire!  I forgot about the effect of your elevation on the sun set time.  I am learning so much from you guys I should go on a game show!

Enjoy,

love mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Paul &#038; Chris, Sounds like another good day.

Water tho, it&#039;s hard to imagine it not tasting the same right? But what a difference there is!  And the scenery like a movie set, so amazing via picture, &#039;live &#038; in person&#039; must be most awesome. Mark should be home &#038; I&#039;m sure recalling the beauty of it all... What a trip.

xoxo]]></description>

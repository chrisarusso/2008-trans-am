		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

Who might the early riser be that you know?  I believe you wake up before Paul almost every day....apples don&#039;t fall very far......

I guess Lauren will remain a mystery.  I think the Bristol Police are reading your blog and radioing (word?) ahead to harass you (is this joke old yet?).

Your flexibility is a great trait for you guys to have.  You don&#039;t seem to waste much energy worrying about things that don&#039;t work out (couchsurfer) but stay focused on the next goal.  I guess some of us old folk could take a lesson from you youngins.

keep bringing it and be safe.

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

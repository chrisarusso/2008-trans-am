		<description><![CDATA[Chris and Paul,

Not up for golf early in the morning?  Meeting up with &quot;back home&quot; friends was cool.
Snoop would not have been my first choice but I don&#039;t think John Denver does them anymore (talk about corny).  Glad you enjoyed the concert.

What will be a better record of the exciting trip than your blogs?

Be safe guys.

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

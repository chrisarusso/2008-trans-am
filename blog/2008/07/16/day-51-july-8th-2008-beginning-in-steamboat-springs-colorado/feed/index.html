		<description><![CDATA[Russo!!! I heard about your sweet adventure through Nick Ragaini when I was home a week ago visiting the parents. I wish I had known sooner y&#039;all could&#039;ve had a place to stay the first few days at my house in Orlando. But anyways, I just caught myself up on your adventure, and it seems like you&#039;re having a blast. Traveling the country and meeting new people is definitely worth it&#039;s weight in gold as you have found out. Glad to hear you&#039;ve met such nice people willing to let you crash at their places when you need to. It definitely is a humbling experience. I wish you, and Paul, the best of luck on the rest of your trip and look forward to reading about it.

Sorry to hear about the departure picture that did not happen.  Those are pretty special for us to see.

Wyoming may not be Colorado but I am sure there are some special times ahead for you two there!

		<description><![CDATA[Chris and Paul

Instead of paying forward I am commenting backward (to catch up).
Thanks for the Spanish translation Chris.  You guys exhibited a lot of drive to make the long ride on this day without many breaks.

Sounds like the barbecue was just what the doctor ordered (since food is a major part of your day).  

see ya,

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

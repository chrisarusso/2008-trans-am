		<description><![CDATA[Guys,

Is a smothered Burrito a breakfast food?!  Cool mural and great hosts! Thanks Jenny and John.  Keep the good pictures coming.  Not sure the leap off the cliff was well thought out but why start now?

The Little Ceasar&#039;s stop shows that the word is full of good people (they just don&#039;t live in CT...joke).

Happy trails to you,

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris - Enjoying all your stories - your Colorado pictures were very familiar to us - we knew exactly where you were. We spent the 4th of July a few years ago swimming in some lake/reservoir in Boulder (FREEZING water) and watching the fireworks at the University of Colorado stadium. I am sure you are loving this state - it has the bluest skies and beautiful thunderstorms in the afternoons.  Nice clean dry air!  Enjoy it!!   You would have seen snow if you went to Pikes Peak.  It did snow on the 4th of July at the Eisenhauer (sp?) tunnel the summer we there.  Take care!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was certainly a pleasure to be able to host the guys for a night.  They were very easy and fun company.  

Sorry you had to grill your own dinner, but I know Paul did better than I would have and I promise-the bench was already broken.  It was not due to the countless buffets you&#039;ve been enjoying.  :) 

Anybody is welcome if you&#039;re up in NW Montana.  Give us a call.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When you get back, maybe we can go to a pow wow at the casinos here.  Not sure about Steven S. but the pow wow sounded awesome as well as your host families.  I think Mark is headed for a higher weight class.

		<description><![CDATA[Ditto above. And, yes Chris, it might&#039;ve been SS himself!
Amazing the good fortune you&#039;ve had of riding into cultural experiences as well as lifestyles.

I know this is ahead of the blog date, but Kudo&#039;s to you both for the major accomplishment of going across the country, from Key West to Seattle ~ on a wing, a prayer and a bike! Impressive determination and ability; you two are sooooo inspired and inspiring!

As always, I&#039;m sure for both our families, we are proud of you!

		<description><![CDATA[C hris

I do not like to use the blog as a personal venue but without cell service and therefore the GPS, I cannot communicate with you.  Actually, we did not have cell service in Thompson where the wedding was and I just received your voicemail now. The wedding was great.  A wonderful feast was had by all.  Dan  &#038; Carla were stunning!  Dan actually broke down during his vows!
But we missed you a lot and it was not the same without  the entire Drayla Dr crowd!!

Love ya!  Miss you !!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Guys,

Sorry to hear about the wind but if you were riding with the wind it would mean you would be coming back home and you guys have too many exciting times ahead to come home yet.  I also know that wind will not stop you guys.

Try to keep up with Mark and as mom said we will be at Dan and Carla&#039;s wedding today.  Sorry I can&#039;t trade places with you but someone has to sacrifice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It sounds like some of those winds have followed you into Montana. Hopefully they&#039;ll let up today, or Paul and Chris can just draft behind Mark! Keep up the good work! Stay safe!

		<description><![CDATA[The honking truckers remind me of being on a golf course standing over a putt and a passing car honks.  Since I am not going to sink the two foot putt anyway, they are not achieving much!  They are just jealous...they wish they could ride their bikes thousands of miles and sleep on rock hard ground and ride over mountains.

keep trucking (pun).

love you guys,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris &#038; Paul

I am reading today&#039;s paper and I just read where a bear attacked a camper in Helena, Montana.  Two campgrounds near Yellowstone had to be closed!!! ( Soda Btte and Chief Joseph)

Mark, They do believe it was a grizzly!  And the camper had stored his food properly!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bicycling with a dog in tow, too cute... And the puppies, what nice little highlights, I love it. Glad you two rested your heads &#038; weary bodies on some soft Wyoming grass.

Todays weather isn&#039;t being kind to Colorado, glad you&#039;re not there right now, major hale (sp?-) storms. 

Safe riding today ~ xo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Helloooo... It&#039;s been awhile, I know. I&#039;ve been with you, just not home, so it&#039;s not as easy to write. Sorry.

Seems like every one is coming &#038; going ~ those loved &#038; old friends &#038; new ones alike. I&#039;m sure you all enjoyed your time together.  

Here&#039;s to less rocky roads &#038; more sunshine... may it come your way soon so you can really appreciate that west coast waterfront!

Love to you both.
xoxo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand not wanting to leave a warm comfortable bed on a cold overcast day...but you are not in a warm comfortable bed!  You guys deserve to slow it a bit and enjoy the coast. It remains to be seen if you can keep it up.  Mark in the future may speed you a little.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, boys.  Just commenting to say hi, and wish I was still out on the road, instead of being stuck in my office.  I hope the Disney tickets make it to my brother&#039;s house before you guys do.  Keep on riding!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Poor Meghan!  I can only imagine how much that bike weighs with all the gear on it! I was wondering what that photo was on your site.

Sounds like a fun time with friends. Enjoy while you can because soon reality will set in!

Oh, by the way, Chris, if you and Mghan have decided to part ways, I  guess this is goodbye!

Ride on!  Stay safe!  Miss you!!!

xoxo]]></description>

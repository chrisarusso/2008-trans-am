		<description><![CDATA[Hey Boys... Congratulations, from what I see, you&#039;re in California! As I was writing this I realized I typed &quot;...we&#039;ve arrived in CA&quot; strange error, but it just says how very much we ARE with you ~ hope you&#039;re both feeling all the love ;-) 

Ditto to the Kyle, Terra &#038; Allison... You embraced &#038; nourished them. As their parents, we&#039;re without enough words. Good laugh out of Chris waking Paul while Kyle woke Allison. 

Fabulous coast line.
Til t&#039;moro... Sleep well, you deserve it!

xoxo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris and Paul,

It was a pleasure to host you.  Have a safe rest of your journey.

That is indeed the large Boeing building.  It&#039;s based on volume, so it really doesn&#039;t look that big.  However, a satellite picture shows it&#039;s quite large.

Ride On!

		<description><![CDATA[The Pacific Coast Highway --- #1 on the Today&#039;s Shows places to see in the USA ---  I am so jealous! ( Maybe Grand Canyon is # 1 and the Pacific Coast Highway is # 2--not positive!

I won&#039;t tell you to take tons of pictures because my email can already attest to that so I&#039;ll just ask you both to take it all in and ride in a safe manner!!!

Terra &#038; Kyle (Allison as well!), thank you for opening your home and hearts to my son!  I am certain he already has plans to pay it forward.  As his mom, I appreciate what you have done for him physically and emotionally!!

Thanks again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[sorry i got sick.  My husband forgets I am allergic to eggs and it set off my stomach.  We loved having you and would love for you to come back for a visit.  I would like to comment on the ball thing.  It reminded me too of the movie castaway.  Although his was a volleyball.  Have fun and enjoy your ride.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Hutchisons!!!!!  Chris, a little less on the bodily functions would be nice!  Soccer ball reminds me of &quot;Castaway&quot; (Tom Hanks).  He didn&#039;t get to play soccer with it but it got him through.  Maybe there is a story there somewhere.

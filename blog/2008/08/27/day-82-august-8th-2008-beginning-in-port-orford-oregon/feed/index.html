		<description><![CDATA[We agree with the last 2 posts!

There getting online, just check out the pictures.  They have them updated to when they attended the Dodgers baseball game in LA.  Maybe too much partying going on in sunny CA?

Hey guys we&#039;re still following &#038; interested in your trip!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nina, I second that one!  Our faith in mankind has been rekindled and we, too, are filled with smiling, feel-good moments every time a stranger (or friend/family!!) opens the door for these 2 great hardnosed travelers!! The time/efforts of these hosts is not appreciated.

Have we said THANKS recently!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the road again... Looks like you&#039;re back to substantial riding, how&#039;s it feeling after the mini vacation? 

Loved some of those pictures. Amazing of the redwoods especially when seeing how they compare to you in size WOW and, the cows on the beach are a crack up site to me! And, it looks like the children had fun getting you out of bed Paul, reminds me of a Bandit moment :-)

As you&#039;ve witnessed minimally it seems, not everyone can appreciate embracing a moment ~ I don&#039;t want to repeat myself, BUT, these strangers who&#039;ve opened their homes to you 2-great kids have renewed my faith in humanity. They&#039;ve helped create real smiling, feel-good moments &#038; memories for everyone.  

Ride safely &#038; Enjoy southern Cal!
With much love, Mom Y

		<description><![CDATA[Now you know what reptiles feel like when they bask in the sun to heat up their cold blood.  Not sure we need the pitstop photos (relieving yourselves!!!!!).
Yeah California!  Take your time and enjoy your second favorite state (actually third behind Oregon.).

Be safe and happy trails.  I&#039;ll think of you guys in school tomorrow.]]></description>

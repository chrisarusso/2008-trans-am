		<description><![CDATA[Hey Guys! Sorry for not writing to y&#039;all sooner! Absolutely awesome pictures! Give me an idea of when you will be Cali and I will check my timeshare availability. I also have a friend who lives in Folsom, CA (near Sacramento). If you plan on staying in the northern part for a bit I can ask him if you can stay with him for a night or two. He&#039;s got a great house and pool!
Travel safely and enjoy the ride!
Love, 
Aunt Marie]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark ~ A big  WOW, You did it well!

Chris, not sure if Paul relayed the thought of maybe including the mileage tally on the days heading... would be cool.

Seems like another &#039;fabulous family&#039; &#038; I haven&#039;t checked the pictures yet, but the waterfront on the map seems as appealing a view as any!

Enjoy your downtime in Portland &#038; Meghan&#039;s company.

We&#039;re both visual learners.  Looking forward to the rest of the story.  Drop us a line when you get a chance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys the shoulder does not look that big in the photo.  At least you have a solid wall in case you tip over you can catch yourself before you hit the ground!!!!.  Does not look that safe to me.

Hope the bears stay away from your campgrounds.  I was watching a golf match the other day and a bear walked across one of the fairways (I think he was headed for Oregon).

safe trip Meghan!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gee whiz, Gabby, that experience really was awful.  That no-name biker was pretty stupid to nail you the way he did.  Not even an apology.  What a jerk.  Certainly, Paul and Chris would be more helpful.  Hopefully, California will have more blue skies and dry weather for you guys.  Scenic Rt. 1 will be a beautiful sight to see. take it easy and be careful.

		<description><![CDATA[A couple sundays ago I went for a nice relaxing run on the Charles River. And on my way back, I took a moment to stretch. As I crossed over the path, for both pedestians and bikers (mainly walkers and runners) I got nailed by a biker going about 25 MPH. While it was embaressing, it probably was one of the most funniest things I have ever experienced. He nailed me and legit ran over me as I did a face plant into the tar. His front tired stopped on my head and he landed directly on top of me. After a few bruised ribs and some dizzy spells, I came to the conclusion that I would be much more aware of my surroundings when running. I received no apology from this mystery biker and at the moment and having some resentment towards bikers across America. But you, keep trucking, and see you soon!]]></description>

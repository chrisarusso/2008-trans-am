		<description><![CDATA[This is so great to see and read.  What a terrific experience.  While we all suffer the high costs of fuel for our driving, you guys picked the perfect time to beat the use of fuel with all your travels.  Be safe and careful.  I was so glad you didn&#039;t do this trip alone.  KCT]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mom has kept me posted on your every move but tonight (it is way past my bedtime) I decided to go back and read all of your blog entries.  Your writing is so entertaining I could not stop...hence it is very late.  You decided on &quot;life was good&quot; as a sign off.  I like it and I assume you chose the past tense to describe the day&#039;s events.  Life is good would work too as all of the experiences, good food, and good people you come across are defining your life as it is now.  I am not sure I am supposed to write all of this here but I will check in tomorrow and you can advise me.  Stay safe, hi to Paul and we are all enjoying this ride you are taking!!!!  Love,    Dad]]></description>

If you expect nothing and get mediocrity, it looks like gold!

		<description><![CDATA[Chris...nice quote.  That idea has been stated many different ways.
As in any goal you have in life, most of the fun comes from the striving for it.  When you end this journey of yours you will see that what you went through and all the people and places you experienced will be more important than the achieving the end goal.  All we can say back here is &quot;make it special&quot;, we are proud of you and we are all enjoying the ride!!!

Be safe,

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris!  I was peeking in on you guys when you first started your adventure, but I got real busy with the close of the school year and lost track of you guys for a while (although I was occasionally updated by your dad).  Best wishes for an enjoyable, safe trip.  May you have many tailwinds - esp on you way up the Rockies!]]></description>

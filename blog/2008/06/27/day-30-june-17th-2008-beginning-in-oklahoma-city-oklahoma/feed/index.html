		<description><![CDATA[Hey chris,

I am finally out of BHS.....even though you had a late start you achieved your final destination.  Always good to be flexible with the weather(late start)!!!!  We keep telling how enjoyable it is to read your blogs.  I think for me it is almost like riding along with you and I get to experience places I will probably never get to.   I am anxious to see when all is said and done which city(s) will be your favorite.  Yes, you break more wind than paul (pun...I guess I meant draft.).

happy trails,

love mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Chris and Paul,
It seems like there are alot of flat areas to ride through.  The scenery is really neat to see.  Happy Belated Birthday to Paul.
Looks like the nice weather was mostly on your side throughout your trip.  Take it easy and am continuing to follow along with you both.  Be safe and rested.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can&#039;t say enough about the blog and all the pictures guys.  I&#039;m a big fan of the new &quot;post every day&quot; format.  I look forward to reading it every morning.  I have to say though, after a great buildup for the doubledare to play curtis jackson on the jukebox, I was pretty disappointed in the way the story ended.  I would have enjoyed to hear about the reaction from the locals who were sulking in the corner.  However, for safety&#039;s sake, you probably made the right decision.  

Keep up the good work and stay safe!

		<description><![CDATA[Chris, 

Happy birthday to Paul!!!!!  I am sure this was his favorite birthday celebration ever because you were there!  I am surprised 50 cent was even a choice!  Anyway, you can&#039;t judge all the people from Arkansas based on this one stop (it must have been filled with people my age!).

Happy trails to you (Roy Rogers and Dale Evens).

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

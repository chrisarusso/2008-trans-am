		<description><![CDATA[Paul... Happy Birthday!

This may be one of your most interesting &#038; memorable in your 23 years. Hoping it&#039;s a beautiful day, cool with wind at your back ~ for smooth riding as you two move on into Oklahoma. As you know, we&#039;re with you online &#038; in spirit everyday. So be well, enjoy todays ride. And, MAYBE you&#039;ll be able to find a dish of pasta &#038; hot peppers along with an ice cream (pref: Friendly&#039;s) so it&#039;ll be a somewhat familiar B&#039;day! 

And Chris, the blog is nothing less than entertaining, I lol!
You guys are doing great, I don&#039;t know there&#039;s a need to rush thru it so... Breath it in.

Our Love ~ Mom &#038; Dad xoxo
PS: Your gifts are being deposited :-) Love you]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys.  Just wanted to give you a shout.  I check out the site multiple times a day to see where you&#039;re at and read the blogs.  I must say that your blogs make for some of the most entertaining read I have done.  And with all these extremely exciting and personable accounting and finance books that I&#039;ve been reading, that is really saying a lot!!

Seriously though, I love the site...

Glad to hear the trip is going well and you guys are staying safe.  Good luck and I&#039;ll talk to you soon.

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

Happy Birthday to Paul!!!!!  It is wierd seeing you at Milwood Lake but reacting to your comments about spelunking in Fla.  I realize the torrid pace you guys keep does not give you downtime to write in the journals and blog.  I wonder if anyone actually did what you guys  are doing but had a digital voice activated recorder to keep track of all the experiences as you go.  No matter now because this is &quot;a trip&quot; for all of us back here.  Hope you meet more great people and a long drink of sweet tea is in your near future.  Stay safe!

love,  Mom and Dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gee,
I was up in the Catskills on 6/7-8 for a friend&#039;s dad&#039;s 90th Birthday and the flies were brutal up there also.  The locals there were saying that NY released alot of flies several years ago to  take care of the tent catepillars, and the flies have overstayed their welcome.  There weres so many, that I thought we could just open our mouths to talk and maybe inhale one.

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

Maybe writing for a career may come out of all of this.  Each new blog is more interesting than the one before.  Sorry to hear about the horseflies but I think they got the worst end of the deal.   I am sure they are glad you are gone.  Once again the great hospitality and free food is highlighted in your writing.  Coach P (up from Florida) came to Berlin high and I gave him your web page so you will have another follower.  This is starting to feel like &quot;history in the making&quot;.  Keep the great pictures and blogs coming!!!!!!!!  Thank you to Paul for sticking this out with you because it is much easier for us knowing you guys are together. As usual, be safe and have fun!!

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Chris and Paul, 

Chris, after reading this post i couldnt help but think of how handy a ping pong paddle would have been on that walk/run through the cloud of horseflys.
The web site is great (even though this isnt the real website yet), but it is fun to follow your trip.  I feel like i check on you guys progress 10 times a day, it sure is a lot more interesting than anything i do on a day to day basis.  Keep up the good pace you guys are on and i look forward to hearing more about your trip.  It looks like the rocky mountains are in the near future, make sure to take some good pictures out there.  Good luck, stay safe and keep having fun.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Chris (and Paul),
Everyone here in the office is following along on your journey and I, for one, eagerly anticipate each new entry. The GPS is cool but you don&#039;t get the stories that accompany them √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù the horsefly massacre, all the friendly people, and Paul&#039;s 8,493,089th flat tire. 

Be safe and keep up the great blogging.

		<description><![CDATA[Hilarious Nightmare :-) Paul should&#039;ve related as we had similarly been attached on Fire Island one summer (tho he may have been a baby). Depending on where you live, you can become a professional killer of attacking insects. I too would prefer not to kill anything ever, however, when it&#039;s a matter of survival...  Upstate NY can get pretty bad &#038; years ago (many again ~ Ugh) I was racking up about 10 at a time with a notebook, non-stop &#038; became quite impressed with this ability &#038; frankly perfected it as it went on for days on end.
Anyway. Glad you&#039;re meeting such good people ~ Kansas, Oh my! Have a safe ride into Colorado today! Love Mom Y, xoxo]]></description>

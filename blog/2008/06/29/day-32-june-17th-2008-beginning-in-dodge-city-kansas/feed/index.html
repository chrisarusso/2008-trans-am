		<description><![CDATA[Some inspiration!!!!!!!

Rocky Mountain High
John Denver
Words by John Denver; Music by John Denver and Mike Taylor

He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin&#039; home to a place he&#039;d never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin&#039; by a song
But the string&#039;s already broken and he doesn&#039;t really care
It keeps changin&#039; fast and it don&#039;t last for long

But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I&#039;ve seen it rainin&#039; fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky mountain high

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I&#039;ve seen it rainin&#039; fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky mountain high

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I&#039;ve seen it rainin&#039; fire in the sky
I know he&#039;d be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky mountain high

It&#039;s Colorado rocky mountain high
I&#039;ve seen it rainin&#039; fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody&#039;s high
Rocky mountain high]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,  If you reversed the words we would all know that you were talking about the tire and not your ass!  I am surprised that it was your first flat.

As you and Paul know parents like to hand out these golden life secrets so we feel like we are having some effect on your successes.  As both of you know that is a crock because the drive comes from within you two but anyway......here is the golden nuggett of the day
The cold rain, headwinds, and constant climbing that make it more like work (in your words) will make the good times so much better.
We know how mentally tough (may be stubborn or thick headed) both of you are and it will see you through the tough times.  Also, as you will learn...the good times you guys experience on this trip will stay with you forever and you will forget the bad times.
Sort of like raising kids (we won&#039;t go there now!).  Before this gets sentimental I will end.  As always we look forward to your day by day progress.

Happy trails to you.

love,
mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I propose you answer questions from the comments in your upcoming posts. Here&#039;s mine:

You guys said you did no training before starting this trip and now you&#039;re doing 100 miles a day on your bikes. In my head you two start off huffing and puffing just to get your bikes off the kickstands in FL and now you&#039;re both in great shape. How much has your guys health improved? I would guess you&#039;d lose weight, but, you do talk about eating all the time so who knows. Is doing all this biking still hard, or do you just do it no problem?

Anyhow, that was kinda more than one question, but it was one general topic, so that&#039;s gotta count for something. 

Keep up the good work boys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Flat rear huh? Jay humor at its finest...well that and the std time zone picture. 

Also, in some of the blogs where you insert a picture, it looks as though some of the words get erased or covered up. Maybe I&#039;m crazy, but its just an observation I thought was worth sharing.

Keep riding the good ride!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,
You went to a bike shop for a beer?  I think breakfast is your favorite meal, especially if they have chocolate pancakes!  Eating by the canal must have been very nice.

Well everyone here is worried about Squishy.  I hope Squishy makes it back home.  Oklahoma city does look very nice.  I hope you guys take an extra day and enjoy it.

Happy  trails,

love mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

Glad to hear about the southern hospitality.  Did you mean to hint that the people up here would not be as helpful to riders passing through?  Maybe if they were traveling through Hartford!!!!!  It sounds like mom is talking to you upstairs (as I am working on final exams downstairs).  Too bad about the missed turn but what is six miles when you are traveling thousands?  As usual it is a trip watching your trip across USA!

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi! The package arrived Paul. I guess there&#039;s really no time to get into someone else&#039;s head or writings (especially these books) when your busy trying to put your own down on paper right? So, do I owe Lacy &#038; Ryan $ to cover the cost of this ~ you let me know, ok?
I&#039;m sure traveling lighter must be a good thing for you both. I do believe you made it for the Stanley Cup so, your timing was good...
as usual stay strong &#038; focused.  Hey, I&#039;m a believer! xoxo]]></description>

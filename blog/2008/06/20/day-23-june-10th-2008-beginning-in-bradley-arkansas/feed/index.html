		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

I am commenting backward (instead of paying forward), I will be out of school soon and I will be able to keep up.  Why would you want to drink buttermilk!!!!!!!!!!!  An east to west wind is great for you guys as long as it is the southern end of a high pressure system (and not the northern end of a low pressure system!).

Watch the weather!!  You probably are aware the &quot;rocky mountain high&quot; guy is way up in the sky!!!!  Enjoy Arkansas.  It is still weird communicating with your past!

Happy trails to you.

Love,

Dad and mom (switched the order)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris, you sound like our daughter.  She tells us all the time she doesn&#039;t know how we can get close enough to buttermilk to drink it.  Ha!  You just needed some cornbread crumbled up in it with some green onion chipped up in it.  Yum, yum!

Jack got a kick out of your picture next to the fire truck in Bradley, Ark.  We didn&#039;t tell you, but, Jack retired in 1990 after 25 years in the Ruston Fire Dept.  He also served as a crash crew fireman while in the U.S. Airforce in his younger days.

Be safe, and we&#039;re continuing to pray for you both.

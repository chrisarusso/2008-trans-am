I just remember that time where you said you were going to try to stop... but I had forgotten all about your Dumb and Dumber recitations, ron burgundy etc.... but I still stand by my second statement. Ok bye!]]></description>

Because it just so happens that I saw an albino hippie playing the guitar the other day. She had no pigment and needed sunscreen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I laughed so hard reading about your day.  You guys are just so hysterical.  I agree with your dad, Chris.  Paul should just take a break, enjoy the landscapes.  Sorry to hear about the sight of the colt.  Your ride should still have more great things to experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you write about your various trials and tribulations associated with using the bathroom or lack thereof? That would make for an interesting read. 

Just kidding. The blog is awesome.

Take care.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

Sorry to hear about the horse and breakfast.  Beautiful lake and free lodging though....can&#039;t have everything.  Tell Paul to leave the women alone...he needs to conserve his energy!  Besides, Dirty, sweatie, and smelly is not that attractive!

Happy trails to you,

love, mom and dad]]></description>

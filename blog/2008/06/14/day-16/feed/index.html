		<description><![CDATA[Chris

So the bikers you ran into were celebrating a 60th birthday.  So there is hope for me to try this next year (when I am 60)...right!  Maybe a motorcycle (actually a limo).  Love the shirts on your sleek bodies.  Fortunately the snickers you love so much do not have a chance of remaining on your body.   Hi to Paul and to Meghan (when you talk to her).

Happy Trails to you until we meet again.  (you have to be over 50 to know where this comes from).

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What up Russo and Paul,

I finally figured out where your website was...I should have stalked your facebook profile sooner...and have been catching up on the blogs.  Good to hear all is well and that people have been so helpful along the way.  Keep up the good work, stay hydrated, and keep those bikes lubed!  

Ride On]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Helloooo...  I didn&#039;t think it looked right (oops) Vail.
Haven&#039;t heard from you &#038; know you two are lovin Colorado so, hopefully, you&#039;ll read this tonight. The Kelly&#039;s offered up their condo for a few days, they&#039;ll drive you over &#038; back to Denver if you&#039;d like. They arrive at the Denver airport t&#039;moro around noon. Just let me know if you&#039;re interested. 

&quot;Squishy&quot; (too funny) looks exhausted ~ hope he had fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris and Paul,

We are so relieved that Squishy is back!  Sounds like you have found great hosts again and have made some nice memories again.  I am sure Paul&#039;s creation was very good even if he didn&#039;t think so.  It is hard to beat good company, good food and a movie (not sure that was so good!).  Tomorrow is my last curriculum day and I can say good-bye to BHS until the fall.  Will check in for your blog (to break up the boredom) tomorrow.

Be safe,

love,

mom and dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I still love the blogs. I just wanted to tell you that I love my biking shirt! I just got back from a 20 mile ride (which is like a trip around the block for you guys.) My friend, Toni, also loved the shirt! Chris, maybe you should consider a career in fashion design! I wear the shirt every time I ride! Thanks!
Hope the mountains are going well!

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed ~ Good People!  When Janie comes to Ct (if you guys are back yet) it&#039;ll make for a nice reunion with the Russo&#039;s as well.
While discussing &#039;Good People&#039;, I want you two to know that four West Babylon classmates (to date) extended themselves with their homes. Two you had already passed in Fla, one you were north of in Plano, Texas &#038; another in California (still a possibility). 

Also, amazingly enough, the Kelly&#039;s are going to be in Vale from Fri (t&#039;moro) thru Tues. Mr. K is playing in an Air Force Academy Lacrosse came, any chance you&#039;ll be able to see them? 

Enjoy Colorado &#038; riding those mountains... I guess they make our tough little &#039;hill&#039; forever ridable (for you two at least)!

  * Fixed the fact that multiple categories were not being mailed to (which is
    what delayed the previous changes from getting into CVS).
  * Fixed two places (in the area where there is a limit on the number of
    recipients) where I was not checking for a valid header before sending the
    e-mail. Thanks to sharplesa for alerting me to this oversight:
    http://drupal.org/node/173987
  * Added a TODO.txt file for notes and reminders on things to do.
  * Removed translation functions in areas that didn't work, as reported by
    skizzo in this comment: http://drupal.org/node/145940#comment-284484

  * Added this file.
  * The community has spoken: reverting all constants to upper case.
  * Removed an uncessary validation check in mass_contact_admin_edit_validate.
  * Added periods at the end of a few sentences.
  * Moved code to inform user about node creation inside the check to do it in
    the first place.
  * Changed the way creating categories works so that multiple categories can
    be selected by default, and the mail page will respect those choices.
  * Added the two feature requests listed here: http://drupal.org/node/170837,
    namely, hiding the categories checkbox, if there is only one category, and
    it is set as selected, and showing descriptive text instead of the BCC
    checkbox, if users are not allowed to change the setting.
  * Rearranged the admin settings and the mail page, so that they flowed more
    like a standard e-mail sending form.
  * Tweaked a few things here and there (text, punctuation, etc.).
  * Added more commenting to the code. There's still more to do.
  * Probably some other stuff I forgot about.  :^)  (This was supposed to be a
    quick change to a couple of things that ended up being a much bigger
    update that took a lot longer.)

What is the need we're meeting?
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
There several NEEDs that wikiCommunity satisfies.  I will list them in decreasing order of importance.
	
1. Outside of large organizations... i.e (schools, churches) there isn't a great way, on the web, or elsewhere, to facilitate "meetings" of people 
based on common interest that live in close proximity to one another.  It is a natural desire amongst people to want to socialize with those who share
common interests.  This is an especially strong need for those who have moved, or aren't in schooling years, and don't have a large plug into social pipeline.  
This is a large void of supposedly "social networking" sites have not capitalized on.  Facebook, mysp		ace, etc. are only a confirmation of friends that you already
have, and while they serve their own purpose, in no way do they create new relationships or connections with people in a real way.

2.  Targetted ad medium..
Businesses need to advertise.  Smaller businesses who do not have large advertising budgets, and also don't have a great web-based targetted ad medium, may struggle
due to lack of reach, rather than service or product.  These businesses also don't typically have the technological means, or money to expend on developing a website,
and again even they did, could not easily direct location specific traffic to their site.

3.	Leisure... Holy shit that happened in my town?  I wish I knew.
Locals (like myself) often sit home on the weekend unaware of what cool stuff is going on around them.  Without a newspaper subscription, local events that might not
make the tv news may fly under the radar for many who would have gone if were otherwise aware.  (getting late and my english is struggling)  Even with a newspaper
there isn't an easy way to deliver "customize" information that different citizens may be interested in.

4..  Those who don't live in a city get a grasp of what its like there... community testimonial, etc.
Any sort of relocation, whether it be based on jobs, school, or any other reason, leaves people with many choices of places to live.  If they have never visited
County A, they don't have a great way to distinguish between city Aa, Ab, or Ac.  City websites are often terrible, and especially if it's not a metropolitan, leave
a person with no real information about what it would be like to live in this city.

5.  Why don't they change the effing traffic light in the middle of town?
The collective voice of the citizenship is often thwarted by the solitary voice of those in power...  WHAT??  Don't like public policy?  Don't have time to go to 
town hall to dispute local law making.  Opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one, and everyone thinks everyone else's stinks.  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to
vent about public policy, or otherwise within your city.  What if, with enough support, the policy could be changed?


Who is our target?

Target 1: Everyone with an internet connection.  This service would be most useful to maybe middle-school aged and up.  Middle schoolers would use it primarily for
sports and video games.  Young adults who have more diverse interests, and different values could use it for a much wider array of things like interest in the arts,
music, politics, philosophy... etc  Even older folks who actually use the night would be a great target because they have a lot of time on their hands
and are always seeking companionship since most of their family has very busy lives and can't always be there.  Definitely a wide diverse demographic to serve.

Target 2: Small local businesses (not chains) with small ad budgets, and a need for a tight geographically targetted advertisement medium.  There are MILLIONS across
the U.S. alone. (it'd be cool to do this elsewhere too -- down the line) The target group within businesses would be food and entertainment.  I envision users
using the site primarily for "what to do in city x", and food is almost always involved as well as some other form of night entertainment.

Target 3:	This seems to be more of a younger demographic (18-34) or whatever it may be.  Targeted at people with expendable income, and little responsibility.
Reasoning: those who will be continually seeking different entertainment and places to eat.  

Target 4:	Relocators.  Those who want access to the "feel" of a community without ever having lived there, or maybe never having visited.  People who are going
away for college, or switching jobs across the country.  People who are just looking for a new experience, may be interested in purusing many cities to "see" what 
they are like

Target 5:	Young adults and up.  More of a mature group for the 'Public Policy' aspect.  The type of people that are involved in the community and want to put 
their two cents in.

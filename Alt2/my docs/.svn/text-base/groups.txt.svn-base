Groups Page -- Call it societies -- sounds more community oriented?	
First off what should our tops groups be?
No reason user can't join group outside of his/her city... but cannot create a group there.
Default to search only within city, but allow for expanded search.  What should proximity be?  
Consider only allowing non-logged-in to not have option to searc more than city.

Layout: First Page should Have a small link at the top to the group adding page
		Rest of page should be expandable tree structure of current groups that are toggleable up and down and populate with 
		There should be a searchable area that a user can enter search terms for the group.
		There should also be a way for the user to expand the scope of his search beyond the city's borders.  
		Pulldown menu that says search option
		Never allow expansion of the tree to encompass more than city... would be too much for the page.
		But searaching would be fine to include more, and it could also be broken up by top category.
be Primary Category in first select menu... Populate Subcategory in second select menu in onchnage event.

Rules: ONly users of that city can add a group to it, but users of anywhere should be able to join.
	Groups should by default send out emails prior to events, but allow people to opt out of them.

Should have base set of groups in the db for the first two levels... I.e. sports - soccer .... and then anything after taht
becomes the city_group table with pointer to the parent soccer.

Something to stress is the idea of meeting new people through common interests, instead of current friends you already have 
displaying the fact that they share an interest.

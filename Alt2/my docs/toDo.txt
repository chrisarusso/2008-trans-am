To Do 

Technologically;
1.  Download zip database and load all real content (including appropriate redirects) etc.  Write conditional php script that automates this.  
this way as I make decisions later about how large cities, for example, will be treated.  i can truncate and make the adjustment to the script.
2.  Get calendar extension or write own calendar functionality so that it can
	- add events
	- allow people to join events
	- allow for reminders via email or what have you aobut those events
3.  Consider reskinning, but at very least get good icon.
4.  Fix userlogin to include city/state and check against them being filled out
5.  Set up the group listing both in terms of what lists to preload, and also handling the ui/ concept of how users will add groups
and how to maintain this
6.	Figure out how to layer it such that only users with an account with a credit card can edit the "ad" sections
7.	Figure out tell em why you're mad section (voting, etc.)
8.	Figure out photo section and how to manage that.
9.  Figure out general page logic in terms of summary stuff up front that's either expandable/collapsible or just goes to subpage or both.
10. Handle different users citizen labeling like founder... and also their inherent permissions.
11. Captcha or anything else to consider?




Business
1.	Attract attention anyway possible (espn, ellen, entrepreneur mag)
2. 	Get bike (hoepfully get sponsored... what's the hook?)
3.  Figure out how to show live mapping of route
4.	Figure out where to host
5.  Business Loan?
6.  Way down the line but decide on pricing scheme for ads.
7.	Figure out legalities via kathleen, etc.


Experience:
1. 	Determine route
2.  Determine sites
3.  Determine departure date.
4.  Get balls deep in a good time.

Things thought of later...  Username repeat is okay right?  Hopefully it is because we are storing user data across all cities
and should allow the same name in different locales.
